Their best performance has been a third place finish and given the talent in their team, they certainly deserve a better position.<\/p><p>Currently, there are placed 3rd in the Zone B points table and have a slender 1 point lead over the 4th placed Bengal Warriors. The Titans still have 6 matches left in the group stage including 3 of their home leg. With all 6 teams of Zone B in reckoning of a play-off spot, here's how the Telugu Titans can make it to the 2nd round of the sixth season of PKL -<\/p><p>In the Zone B points table, Bengaluru Bulls seemed to have locked their play-off position as they have 59 points to their name in just 17 matches. The second and third positions are wide open with Bengal Warriors, Patna Pirates and Telugu Titans being the top contenders for the 2 positions.<\/p><p>Patna Pirates are 7 points ahead of Telugu Titans but have played one match more than the Titans. The maximum number of points that Patna could have at the end of group stage is 76. While, the maximum number of points that Telugu Titans could have at the end is 74. On the other hand, fifth and sixth placed teams UP Yoddha and Tamil Thalaivas are almost out of the race with just 34 points each. UP can have a maximum 59 points by the end of league while Tamil Thalaivas can only have 54 points. So, these two teams may not be causing troubles in Titans' road to play-offs.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/b64ec-15444457442664-800.jpg\" alt=\"Titans will clash with UP Yoddha next\" \/><figcaption>Titans will clash with UP Yoddha next<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>For Telugu Titans to make it to the play-offs, they need to win their matches against the Patna Pirates and Bengal Warriors as they are their prime competitors. Losing against any of the two sides would give their rivals the upper hand in the race. Bengal have to still play their home leg and a lot will depend on their performance at Kolkata.<\/p><p>Vizag should concentrate on winning all the 3 matches of their home leg and win 1 or 2 of the remaining 3 games to seal their play-off spot. A third place finish is likely for the Telugu Titans in the Zone B. However, if they fail in their home leg, their wild-card match against Puneri Paltan and the last match against the Bengal Warriors would become do or die for the Vishal Bhardwaj led team.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p>",

Manchester City lost 2-0 to Chelsea that halted their momentum a bit and brought Maurizio Sarri's side right back into title contention following patchy defeats to Wolves and Spurs. Pep Guardiola was a little irked at the press in a defeat that also signals that the Premier League would be harder to win this season.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><blockquote>\"You don\u2019t have to tell me how competitive this league is. It\u2019s you and your analysts that keep saying we are invincible, that we are perfect and that, in February, we are going to win the league. You said that. All of you. Not the manager, not any player, not the club.\u201d<\/blockquote><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/d2be2-15444511496592-800.jpg\" alt=\"David Luiz celebrates his goal that gave Chelsea a stunning win over the defending champions\" \/><figcaption>David Luiz celebrates his goal that gave Chelsea a stunning win over the defending champions<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>&#8203;<\/p><p>Manchester City were shocked at the Stamford Bridge by Chelsea in a display that bodes well for the league. Guardiola, to be fair has always maintained that the title will be very difficult to defend and in fact welcomes the increased competition in the shape of Liverpool primarily. After 16 rounds, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side is the only unbeaten one left in the EPL; and as things stand, Tottenham and Arsenal are at a touching distance too.<\/p><p>How the Champions League groups end up is also of consequence as Liverpool and Tottenham are precariously placed in their groups. They can get knocked out and join Arsenal, Chelsea in the Europa League. Going deep into either Europa or Champions League puts a lot of strain on the league campaign. Manchester City bear the added pressure of being anointed the \u2018best side in Europe\u2019 and their coach would want to mount a serious challenge this season as the traditional powerhouses Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are not as strong as before.<\/p><p>All this rounds up to the question of who really is best placed to win the league? While Tottenham sit third, they are not playing at their home ground yet and are suspect to inconsistency. Arsenal under Unai Emery has been a revelation with a newly grown spine, and yet a title shot may just be too much to handle. That leaves only Chelsea to challenge the top 2, who are separated by a single point (42-41).<\/p><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/1440d-15444531402395-800.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool are menacing and currently at the top of the league by a single point\" \/><figcaption>Liverpool are menacing and currently at the top of the league by a single point<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>&#8203;<\/p><p>Not even Guardiola with his tactical nous could conquer the league in the first time of asking and struggled in his debut 2016-17. Antonio Conte did though the same year with Chelsea. While equally capable, Maurizio Sarri may just be a few key players short to emulate that. The top teams are closer in talent and personnel than before and as always the unpredictability of the teams further down makes for a situation that can flip and flop multiple times until the fag end of the season.<\/p><p>It does come down then to Liverpool, title-less since 1990 and who courted J\u00fcrgen Klopp to Anfield to deliver one, the first one in the modern era. Klopp has stated that he wanted to win within 4 years and 2019 marks his fourth year.<\/p><p><iframe style=\"max-width:100%\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bzq1GSFR6bQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p><p>Whatever comes off the forthcoming frenetic December fixtures, Liverpool-Manchester City-Chelsea are going to be locked in a battle of attrition. The last time the title was decided on the last day in 2011-12 when City clinched it win an injury-time winner by Sergio Ag\u00fcero. We can expect a scramble until the last day, surely. The indications point to it.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p>",

The former Barcelona man has had a successful managerial career, having won every major trophy available. He's regarded as one of the best managers in the world, and some even consider him the best manager ever.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Spaniard became famous with his tiki-taka football in Barcelona, as the Catalans were nearly untouchable during his tenure, and even gave their arch-rivals, Real Madrid, a 5-0 thrashing. His second venture with Bayern Munich was also a successful one, winning the Bundesliga title on all three occasions.\u00a0<\/p><p>The former Barcelona boss is currently at Manchester City where he has changed the dynamic of English football altogether. Last season, City broke the points tally, reaching 100 points in the league. <\/p><p>However, what stands out is the brand of football the blue half of Manchester City is showcasing at the moment. They are hard to beat, and are well on course to successfully retain the Premier League.<\/p><p>A man like Pep Guardiola who is so much praised by the footballing world is not short of haters either. He has been criticised for shutting players out, players he didn't fancy at all. Here is a list of three former Barcelona players who don't seem to be on the good books of the Spaniard.<\/p><hr><\/hr><h3>#3 Yaya Toure<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/4e5a0-15444490000664-800.jpg\" alt=\"Toure suffered under Guardiola, both at Barcelona and Manchester City\" \/><figcaption>Toure suffered under Guardiola, both at Barcelona and Manchester City<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Guardiola is the dream manager of almost every player in the world. However, one man who will be glad never to have to play under him again is Yaya Toure.\u00a0<\/p><p>At 23, the Ivorian midfielder was at Olympiacos, emerging as one of the brightest prospects in Europe, and drawing the attention of top clubs in the world. A Barca deal got finalised, and Toure became the trusted defensive anchor behind Xavi and Deco. But when Pep took over, things changed.<\/p><p>Pep sold\u00a0Ronaldinho & Deco, and brought in the likes of Pedro and Busquets. The arrival of the Spanish midfielder eventually resulted in Toure's downfall. This left Toure aggravated, and he moved to City, claiming Pep didn't care about him until the transfer offer came in.\u00a0<\/p><p>Years later, they reunited again at City where Yaya again found himself on the bench.

He won the treble for Barcelona under Guardiola, and another one with Inter Milan under Jose Mourinho. Across the two campaigns, the Cameroonian professional footballer scored a total of 52 goals.\u00a0<\/p><p>Despite Pep Guardiola winning LaLiga and the Champions League in his first season at Barcelona, Eto'o felt the manager had proved nothing. The former Chelsea man felt slighted about being told what to do. <\/p><p>Eto'o didn't like Pep lecturing him about how a striker should play when Guardiola himself was a midfielder as a player. Both of them <a href=\"http:\/\/en.espn.co.uk\/football\/sport\/story\/294417.html\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly <\/a>spoke only few times throughout their season together, before Samuel moved to Italy.

The Spaniard replaces Syrian playmaker Mahmoud Al-Amna, who was released by the club a couple of days ago.<\/p><p>Toni, who plied his trade for Bengaluru FC last season in the Indian Super League, left the club at the end of the season and joined Cypriot top flight club Nea Salamina, where many Spanish footballers play.<\/p><p>But that turned out to be a disaster for the talented winger who didn't play a single match for his new club. Nea Salamina currently stand at the sixth position of the league table with 19 points from 12 matches.<\/p><p>Dovale has fallen out of favour with coach Savvas Poursaitidis and when a call came from East Bengal, he couldn\u2019t ignore it. He will in all likelihood arrive at Kolkata by December 14.<\/p><p>During his time with Bengaluru FC, he played 13 matches in the ISL and helped the team reach the final of the tournament. But his real talent was on display in the AFC Cup, where he was deployed in a more attacking role by the then Bangaluru coach Albert Roca, scoring three times in four games.<\/p><p>Dovale started his youth career at local club Ural CF and spent four years at Barcelona's academy. He then joined Celta B and was promoted to the senior team subsequently, where he played under Luis Enrique, the current Spanish national team coach.<\/p><p>However, he was deployed on the left side, which he failed to enjoy much success. As a result, he was continuously omitted from the first team squad, which forced him to quit the club. After spending two years at Sporting Kansas City and Lugo, Dovale came back to La Liga and joined Leganes. He was signed by Rayo Vallecano after two seasons at Leganes and last season, joined Bengaluru FC.<\/p><p>East Bengal, meanwhile, have lacked creativity in the midfield in the absence of a proper playmaker. Al-Amna played well in the Calcutta Football League but he injured himself in pre-season training camp in Malaysia. As he failed to recover in time, the club decided to release the Syrian with the official confirmation coming on Monday.<\/p><p>In other news involving the club, Mexican striker Enrique Esqueda picked up an injury in the match against Gokulam Kerala FC. The Mexican fractured his rib, which will take at least eight weeks to heal. That means he will not be available until February.<\/p><p>The club are pondering whether to release him but the coach has opposed any such move.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p>",

The things became worse when they lost to the Boston Celtics by 56 points in their last match. It was the biggest loss in franchise history.<\/p><p>The players surely were very disappointed, and according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.in\/nba\/story\/_\/id\/25493942\/chicago-bulls-players-push-back-coach-jim-boylen-aggressive-style\" target=\"_blank\">Malika Andrews of ESPN<\/a>, players held a \"Players-only meeting\" before the practice.<\/p><p><strong>Below is what the report has to say:<\/strong><\/p><blockquote>Some Bulls players pushed back on Boylen's aggressive coaching style. After suffering the worst loss in franchise history Saturday night,\u00a0Zach LaVine\u00a0and\u00a0Justin Holiday\u00a0led a two-hour, players-only meeting in lieu of the practice Boylen had planned for the team Sunday.<\/blockquote><p>There were also reports that players wanted to skip the practice, but few Veterans urged everybody to come and have a meeting.<\/p><p>According to Wendell Carter Jr., players have been straightforward and honest with the coach and management, which might be a positive sign.<\/p><p>Boylen however, is being confident that he and the players will get on the same path.<\/p><blockquote>\"We're still learning about each other,\" Boylen said. \"I've moved over the 18 inches [from one chair on the bench to the next]. They're still learning how I want it. There's been a little shock and awe here in the last seven days. And there's an adjustment to that.\"<\/blockquote><p>Boylen has been the coach for a very few matches till now, and it is very early to say or predict anything. The win against the OKC brought a lot of praise for him, but the loss did the opposite. So it is very early to judge the man, and we should give him some breathing room.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p>",

A new team Pune 7 Aces have been added this season making it a nine team affair. All these nine teams have enough firepower and would be vying for the ultimate goal of winning the title.<\/p><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/589c2-15444498266674-800.jpg\" alt=\"Viktor Axelsen is the highest ranked player for Ahmedabad Smash Masters\" \/><figcaption>Viktor Axelsen is the highest ranked player for Ahmedabad Smash Masters<\/figcaption><\/figure><p align=\"justify\"><\/p><p align=\"justify\">Ahmedabad Smash Masters are returning for their second season this year after a disappointing loss in the semi-final in the first appearance. The franchise is based in Ahmedabad and its home stadium is The Arena by TransStadia. The Ahmedabad based franchise was founded after the second season and is owned by Padmanabh Sports Pvt Ltd.<\/p><p align=\"justify\">After a commendable performance in the inaugural season where they lost a closely contested semi-final game, PBL 2018 could be pivotal for them. Ahmedabad smash masters took a huge risk by not retaining their star from previous season, HS Prannoy. However, their picks this season is more of a mixed bag collections.<\/p><p align=\"justify\">The team has a solid backbone and could prove to be darkhorse in this season. Ahmedabad team has world number three men\u2019s singles player Viktor Axelsen of Denmark as their captain. Their roaster also consists of India\u2019s first choice mixed duo, N Sikki Reddy and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy which could be a difficult proposition to face for opponents in front of the home crowd. Saurabh Verma is the only Indian known face in the men\u2019s singles section.<\/p><p align=\"justify\">The one section where the team could be considered weak is women\u2019s singles, where the only known face is Scotland\u2019s world number 25 Kirsty Gilmour. The completely untested Vaishnavi Bhale is the second women singles player.<\/p><p align=\"justify\">They have a mixed bag and the one visible weakness they have is the lack of strong backup in the singles event. Though, they could still prove their mettle and can shock their way to the finals.<\/p><hr><\/hr><p>Here is a full schedule of their journey in this season of PBL:<\/p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Match #1<\/strong><\/p><p align=\"justify\">Date: 23 December<\/p><p align=\"justify\">Opponent: North Eastern Warriors<\/p><p align=\"justify\">City: Mumbai<\/p><p align=\"justify\">Timing (IST): 19:00<\/p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Match #2<\/strong><\/p><p align=\"justify\">Date: 26 December<\/p><p align=\"justify\">Opponent: Delhi Dashers<\/p><p align=\"justify\">City: Hyderabad<\/p><p align=\"justify\">Timing (IST): 19:00<\/p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Match #3<\/strong><\/p><p align=\"justify\">Date: 28 December<\/p><p align=\"justify\">Opponent: Bengaluru Raptors<\/p><p align=\"justify\">City: Hyderabad<\/p><p align=\"justify\">Timing (IST): 16:00<\/p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Match #4<\/strong><\/p><p align=\"justify\">Date: 30 December<\/p><p align=\"justify\">Opponent: Chennai Smashers<\/p><p align=\"justify\">City: Pune<\/p><p align=\"justify\">Timing (IST): 16:00<\/p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Match #5<\/strong><\/p><p align=\"justify\">Date: 4 January<\/p><p align=\"justify\">Opponent: Awadhe Warriors<\/p><p align=\"justify\">City: Ahmedabad<\/p><p align=\"justify\">Timing (IST): 19:00<\/p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Match #6<\/strong><\/p><p align=\"justify\">Date: 6 January<\/p><p align=\"justify\">Opponent: Hyderabad Hunters<\/p><p align=\"justify\">City: Ahmedabad<\/p><p align=\"justify\">Timing(IST): 19:00<\/p><hr><\/hr><p align=\"justify\">(With inputs from Anubhav Bajpeyee)<\/p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Follow Sportskeeda to get the latest updates and news from <\/em><\/strong><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sportskeeda.com\/go\/premier-badminton-league\" target=\"_blank\">Premier Badminton League 2018<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p>",

While the Toronto Raptors continue their dominance at the top of the ladder in the East, the same cannot be said about the West.<\/p><p>In the stacked western conference, there cannot be any off-nights and the teams know that and the players are bringing out their best every night. In this article, let us take a look at the top five points per game leaders through week eight.<\/p><hr><\/hr><h3><strong>#5 Anthony Davis<\/strong><\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/bdc35-15444504973427-800.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Davis continues to shine\" \/><figcaption>Anthony Davis continues to shine<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Stats:<\/strong> <em>26.9 points, 12.4 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.6 steals and 3.0 blocks per game on 50.2 % shooting<\/em><\/p><p>Anthony Davis is one of the top 3 two-way players in the league and after finishing as one of the finalists for Defensive Player of the year and Most Valuable Player last year, he continues to shine and is putting up monster numbers.<\/p><p>'The Brow' has been stuffing the stat sheet since day 1 of the season and is averaging a league-leading 3.0 blocks per game. Despite Davis' heroics, the New Orleans Pelicans are once again struggling to get wins and this should definitely be bothering the franchise.<\/p><p>Using his size and height, Davis is dominating the opposition in the paint and posing problems to the defenders. He is doing a great job from the free-throw line as well and it is high time that others showed up for the Pelicans. With the kind of talent that this team has, the sky is the limit and the sooner they realize their potential, the better.<\/p><p>The 25-year old's highest-scoring game of this season came against the New York Knicks at home. He scored game-high 43 points that night to lead the Pelicans past the Knicks.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><!--nextpage--><h3><strong>#4 Damian Lillard<\/strong><\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/0a406-15444482316595-800.jpg\" alt=\"Damian Lillard's show continues in Portland\" \/><figcaption>Damian Lillard's show continues in Portland<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Stats:<\/strong> <em>27.2 points, 5.2 rebounds, 6.4 assists, 0.8 steals and 0.5 blocks per game on 44.5 % shooting<\/em><\/p><p>People continue to sleep on Damian Lillard and he continues to put on a show scoring heavily everytime he steps his foot on the court. After averaging 26.9 points, 4.5 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game last season, Lillard picked up where left off and the Blazers are currently at the seventh spot in West.<\/p><p>Lillard started the season hot and averaged close to 30 points in October. Though his numbers fell a bit in the last month, those numbers are still enough to put him on this list. Also, he has been exceptional this month and is averaging 30.8 points per game.<\/p><p>Although the 4-time All-Star has been putting numbers like these from the last 3-4 years, people still somehow seem to turn blind eye to him.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><!--nextpage--><h3><strong>#3 LeBron James<\/strong><\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/92492-15444477517403-800.jpg\" alt=\"LeBron James is putting up big numbers\" \/><figcaption>LeBron James is putting up big numbers<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Stats:<\/strong> <em>28.3 points, 7.7 rebounds, 6.9 assists, 1.3 steals and 0.8 blocks per game on 52.1 % shooting<\/em><\/p><p>Playing for a new team does not seem to bother LeBron James or his numbers as he has been stellar so far and is putting up big numbers. The Los Angeles Lakers currently sit on the fifth spot in the Western Conference Standings and the reason is one and only, LeBron James.<\/p><p>He put this team on his back and is carrying every single-night with some breath-taking performances. LeBron, who struggled shooting the ball from behind the arc (27.3 %) in October, is back to being his usual self and shot 42.4 % from long range last month.<\/p><p>The 4-time NBA MVP also had a 50-points game against his former team, Miami Heat. Even though the Lakers struggled early in the season, they are now slowly figuring out things and it will be interesting to see how they perform this season.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><!--nextpage--><h3>#2 Kevin Durant<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/3e2b5-15444472669670-800.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Durant took care of business in the absence of Curry\" \/><figcaption>Kevin Durant took care of business in the absence of Curry<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Stats:<\/strong> <em>29.1 points, 7.8 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 0.9 steals and 1.1 blocks per game on 51.1 % shooting<\/em><\/p><p>There is no answer for Kevin Durant in the league and he continues to dominate the league. Warriors guard Stephen Curry was absent for the most of November and Durant took care of business in his absence.<\/p><p>Even though Warriors missed Curry and lost several games they would not have lost if they had Steph, the two-time finals MVP was stellar and put on some explosive performances. He had three straight 40 or more points games, including his 51 points performance against the league leaders, Toronto Raptors.<\/p><p>His mid-range jumper has been absolute money so far this season and with Curry back in the lineup, even though his numbers might take a dip, he will definitely be able to express himself more freely.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><!--nextpage--><h3>#1 James Harden<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/d5834-15444465895330-800.jpg\" alt=\"James Harden is back at the top\" \/><figcaption>James Harden is back at the top<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Stats:<\/strong> <em>30.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 8.3 assists, 2.1 steals and 0.6 blocks per game on 44.2 % shooting<\/em><\/p><p>It took some time but he is back at the top. Even though the Rockets have been struggling this season, one man has been doing what he does the best and that is James Harden. He had 4 40-point games so far, including his 54 points performance against the Washington Wizards on the road.<\/p><p>James Harden struggled from the three-point line in November but that did not stop him from going for 30-points like it is nothing. The defending MVP has been known for drawing contacts all his NBA career and this season is no different, as he is attempting close to 10 free-throws every game.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sportskeeda.com\/basketball\/5-best-nba-draft-classes-of-all-time\" target=\"_blank\">ALSO READ: 5 Best NBA Draft classes of all time<\/a><\/p><p>The Rockets have not enjoyed much success so far this season and they need to trade for some role players if they want to give themselves a shot at challenging the Golden State Warriors like they did last year.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p>",

If a losing side prefers consistency in selection, there is no reason why a winning side should not do the same.<\/p><p>It is very likely that Virat Kohli will opt for an unchanged side at Perth and if he does, there won\u2019t be much debate on that, as a history-making squad should be persisted with by all means.<\/p><p>However, despite the euphoria and the upbeat mood in the Indian camp, the selection of the playing eleven at Perth should not be a foregone conclusion. Kohli and Shastri must give a serious thought to the composition of the squad that will have the best chance to continue the winning run at Perth too.<\/p><p>The four-man Indian bowling attack had to work extremely hard for one and a half days to get the Aussies dismissed in the second innings. Usually, the Indian team under Kohli goes with five bowlers.<\/p><p>But this time they discarded the fifth bowler in favour of a sixth batsman in the form of Rohit Sharma. So, the workload for the four bowlers was significantly more.<\/p><p>With only three days until the Perth Test, is that enough time for the same set of Indian bowlers to get enough rest and be fresh for the second match? What if India has to bowl first? These are critical questions that need to be considered by the Indian think tank before finalizing the playing eleven.<\/p><p>The core of the team, of course, will remain the same. But there are a few slots that need to be reconsidered. With Ashwin getting the last Australian wicket, the debate about his position has been settled. And though he had a heavy workload, being a spinner, the wear and tear on his body should be relatively less compared to the pacers.<\/p><p>Though all three pacers bowled well at Adelaide, India should consider replacing one of them with either Umesh Yadav or Bhuvneshwar Kumar. So, instead of having three bowlers coming out of a tiring outing, they will have at least one pacer who will be fresh. In fact, it is not a bad idea to have a rotation policy for the fast bowlers in the series.<\/p><p>But if India goes with the same set of bowlers, they should at least consider having a fifth bowling option in the form of Hanuma Vihari who could replace Rohit at number six. That way, the batting strength will not be compromised and Kohli will not have to depend on the not-even-part-time bowling of Murali Vijay to give some rest to his frontline bowlers, as he had to do at Adelaide!<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p>",

Since it's a WWE tag team it's necessary for them to show some extraordinary teamwork in order to beat the opponents and win the championships.<\/p><p>There comes a famous quote \u201cTalent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships.\u201d\u00a0<\/p><p>Tag tam is not just about beating the the opponents, winning the championships and getting the title but it's also to keep it for longer time and to entertain the audience the best way possible.<\/p><hr><\/hr><h3>#3 D-Generation X<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/e02d4-15444420298368-800.jpg\" alt=\"Triple H and Shawn Michael\" \/><figcaption>Triple H and Shawn Michael<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>D-Generation X is definitely one of the greatest groups ever created and they had a great run.\u00a0D-X knew how to own the crowd they were great on mic and back in attitude era they would make people go crazy with their unique forte and hint of humor and comedy.<\/p><p>\"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all age, D-Generation X proudly presents \" this gives immense positivity, the ginormous amount of entertainment, these two were killing it and this is why they were the best among the rest.<\/p><p>They were one of the most influential groups of the Attitude Era, DX were voted the greatest WWE Tag Team Champions in a 2013 viewer poll.

Barrett, and Cameron Reddish.\u00a0All three young men have had an impact, in the Blue Devils season, as the team is 9-1 currently.\u00a0<\/p><p>Today we will profile the strengths and weaknesses of R.J. Barrett. Barrett is a Canadian freshman playing small forward, for the Duke Blue Devils.<\/p><p>Barrett is the son of Canadian international Rowan Barrett. Rowan is currently the Executive Vice President and Assistant General Manager for Canada\u2019s national Basketball team.\u00a0<\/p><p>R.J. gets his basketball pedigree, from his father, Rowan, who, during his playing days, played basketball internationally, in Argentina, Cyprus, Israel, France and Italy.<\/p><p>Rowan, a 6\u20196 small forward, represented Canada, at the FIBA Ameri-Cup, winning silver, in 1999.\u00a0Rowan also represented Canada, at the 2000 Summer Olympics, in Sydney Australia.\u00a0<\/p><p>In 1996, Rowan Barrett went undrafted, although he was eligible, for the NBA Draft. Rowan Barrett was signed, by the Toronto Raptors, in 1997 and again in 1999, by the Raptors, and the Philadelphia 76ers.\u00a0<\/p><p>Rowan never played in an actual NBA game.\u00a0This will not be the case for R.J. Barrett, who looks to begin a long prosperous career, in the NBA, starting on June 20th, 2019, at the NBA Draft Night.<\/p><h3>R.J. Barrett\u2019s Strengths:<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/dd138-15444370975263-800.jpg\" alt=\"Barrett also shows good offensive awareness, in making good passes, to his teammates\" \/><figcaption>Barrett also shows good offensive awareness, in making good passes, to his teammates<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Duke Blue Devils have three big-name collegiate stars.\u00a0When you watch their games, or highlights, of their games, you cannot focus, on one player, without noticing the other two. R.J. Barrett definitely stands out.\u00a0<\/p><p>He has good speed and quickness, in the open floor. He runs hard to fill lanes, on the fast break. He finishes extremely well, at the basket and through contact, especially, since he only weighs 202 pounds at 6\u20197.\u00a0<\/p><p>Barrett also shows good offensive awareness, in making good passes, to his teammates.\u00a0<\/p><p>This makes him a possible point forward, at the NBA level.\u00a0He\u00a0also shows a strong ability to handle the ball. He often advances the ball the length of the court, before distributing or finishing plays himself. Barrett currently is averaging 4.2 assists per game, through 10\u00a0games, with Duke.\u00a0<\/p><p>Another really strong aspect of his game is his ability to catch and shoot and do so, from long range, as well.\u00a0Barrett makes 37.3%, of his three-point attempts.\u00a0<\/p><p>Shooting the three-pointer has become a necessity, for most NBA players. Barrett rebounds well, for a 202 pound, 6\u201d7 small forward.\u00a0He has recorded 72 rebounds, for an average, of 7.2 per game.<\/p><p>Barrett is averaging 24.2 points per game on 47.9% shooting, from the field, which is a solid shooting percentage.\u00a0The Duke Blue Devils have three game changers, on their roster, this season and Barrett clearly is one of them.<\/p><h3>R.J.\u00a0Barrett\u2019s Weaknesses:<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/21e85-15444375224096-800.jpg\" alt=\"Barrett's lightweight and slender size may also affect his effectiveness\" \/><figcaption>Barrett's lightweight and slender size may also affect his effectiveness<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Like his teammate, Zion Williamson, there is not much to nitpick, about Barrett.\u00a0However, unlike Williamson, who may need to slim down, from his college playing weight, of 285 pounds, when he gets to the NBA, Barrett might want to bulk up.\u00a0<\/p><p>At 202 pounds, bigger stronger players await Barrett, in the NBA, and Barrett might get pushed around.\u00a0<\/p><p>Barrett's lightweight and slender size may also affect his effectiveness, of finishing after contact, which he is good at, in college.\u00a0However, at the NBA level the physicality, of the competition, is greater.\u00a0<\/p><p>Barrett may also need to work on his free throw shooting.\u00a0In his 10 games, at Duke, so far, Barrett has connected, on just 63.3%, of his charity stripe attempts.<\/p><p>\u00a0Barrett does show a strong ability to go the length, of the floor, leading the offence and creating offensive opportunities, for himself and teammates.<\/p><p>However, Duke\u2019s only loss this season came against Gonzaga. With time running out, at the end, of the game, Barrett lost the ball, by getting stripped, in the two-point loss.\u00a0Barrett may need to work on protecting the ball better, when advancing it, up the court.<\/p><h3>\u00a0R.J. Barrett may be the second overall pick, at the NBA Draft, in 2019<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/c2b7c-15444311666177-800.jpg\" alt=\"R.J. Barrett may be the second man taken, in this trifecta of greatness\" \/><figcaption>R.J. Barrett may be the second man taken, in this trifecta of greatness<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Coach K and the Duke Blue Devils are mostly concerned, with their collegiate season, and the upcoming March Madness tournament, for right now.\u00a0However, they may pull off an unusual hat trick, at the 2019 NBA Draft.<\/p><p>Duke University among all its other great accomplishments, at the collegiate level, has provided the NBA, with many a great talent, over the years.\u00a0<\/p><p>Duke is poised to send the top 3 picks, in the 2019 NBA Draft, into basketball stardom,\u00a0this coming summer.<\/p><p>R.J. Barrett may be the second man taken, in this trifecta of greatness.\u00a0Barrett's name, from the Duke Blue Devils, will be called, by NBA Commissioner,\u00a0Adam Silver,\u00a0at the 2019 NBA Draft.<\/p><p>The only real question now is, which NBA franchise will have the benefit, of acquiring, a desperately needed talent boost?<\/p><p>For the moment, NBA franchises, like the Phoenix Suns, Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Chicago Bulls and the New York Knicks have the strongest chance at landing one, of Duke's, high profile stars.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p>",

That is a great record, and the loss number would be even less if tag team matches and dark matches aren't considered.<\/p><p>Lesnar seldom loses to the smaller fish in WWE, and most remember the losses he's had with icons of the WWE world, like The Undertaker, Goldberg or John Cena.<\/p><p>Here are 5 Superstars you may have forgotten who beat Brock Lesnar in the WWE.<\/p><hr><\/hr><h3>#1 Rob van Dam<\/h3><p>On paper, this seems like an unlikely pairing for a match - the powerful and strong Brock Lesnar, against an agile, quick wrestler like Rob van Dam, but the two pulled it off in 2002, in three singles matches.<\/p><p>At the start of Lesnar's career, in his very first year in the WWE business, against several big names; Booker T, The Undertaker, Ric Flair, and Hulk Hogan, to name a few.<\/p><p>Rob Van Dam was one of the most recognisable names in ECW, the star of the show, much like what Lesnar became for the WWE. At the 2002 King Of The Ring, RVD and Lesnar faced off in the finals of the tournament, which Lesnar won.<\/p><p><iframe style=\"max-width:100%\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.dailymotion.com\/embed\/video\/x1293sy\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p><p>The very next day on RAW, the two faced\u00a0off for the Intercontinental Championship, which was won by DQ by Rob van Dam, who was holding the belt, after Paul Heyman interfered, following which Lesnar brutalised RVD. At Vengeance, RVD once again defeated Lesnar by DQ after Heyman pulled out the referee from the ring.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><!--nextpage--><h3>#2 Spanky (Brian Kendrick)<\/h3><p>&#8203;<\/p><p><iframe style=\"max-width:100%\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Bh0yH1tVkks\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p><p>Current fans may not know this, but 205 Live's Brian Kendrick wrestled in the WWE back in the early 2000s. Kendrick, who was known by the ring name 'Spanky' in the independent scene, even faced Brock Lesnar, and defeated him (although by DQ) in a match on SmackDown back in 2003.<\/p><p>The segment leading up to the match was a hilarious one where Spanky was backstage with Orlando Jordan and Funaki, chugging down bottles of chocolate syrup (as one would do in the WWE locker room). Spanky sprayed some of that syrup on WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, who was incensed by the \"kid\" soiling his pristine suit.<\/p><p>McMahon put Spanky in a match against Lesnar, who was one of the deadliest heels in the business. Lesnar destroyed the current 205 Live Superstar, before brutalising Kendrick with the chair, which gave Kendrick the win.<\/p><p>Lesnar was in a feud with Kurt Angle at the time, and was to face at SummerSlam for the WWE Championship.\u00a0<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><!--nextpage--><h3>#3 Zach Gowen<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/35f1a-15444519685389-800.jpg\" alt=\"Zacl\" \/><figcaption>Zacl<\/figcaption><figcaption>Gowen faced Brock Lesnar and beat him<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>&#8203;<\/p><p>The very next week on SmackDown, Lesnar brutalised another opponent in Zach Gowen, the one-legged wrestler, in one of the most controversial matches of all time.<\/p><p>Many wrestling fans, to this day, feel that it was inappropriate on the part of the WWE to put a disabled wrestler against Brock Lesnar, and have him completely destroy the young star.<\/p><p>Just days before his high-profile match against Kurt Angle at SummerSlam, Lesnar sent a chilling message to the Olympic hero by brutalising Gowen with a few powerbombs and then smashing his head with a chair, which earned Gowen the win (one of his two singles wins in the WWE; the other was against Matt Hardy).<\/p><p>At SummerSlam, Angle defeated Lesnar and held on to his WWE Championship belt.<\/p><p>The attack on Gowen by Lesnar continued the next week on SmackDown when he was pushed down a flight of stairs by Lesnar.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><p align=\"center\"><\/p><p><iframe style=\"max-width:100%\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/6q7htY6Gi1Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><!--nextpage--><h3>#4 The Rock<\/h3><p><iframe style=\"max-width:100%\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tQpi2ZNh4S0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p><p>Most WWE fans remember Brock Lesnar's first title win, when he won the WWE Undisputed title from The Rock at SummerSlam 2002, to become the youngest champion in the WWE at 25 years of age.<\/p><p>But a few weeks prior to that match, Lesnar was defeated by The Rock, albeit in a triple threat match which also involved Triple H. The Global Warming event in Melbourne, Australia, was for all intents and purposes, a house show (although a DVD of the show was released by the WWE, and then later added to the WWE Network), one of the few live events in Australia back in the early 2000s.<\/p><p>The main event of the show was a match between the Undisputed champion The Rock, and Lesnar and Triple H.<\/p><p>This was the first meeting by The Rock and Lesnar in the ring, and was only one of two matches involving both wrestlers, with the other being at SummerSlam.<\/p><p>In the match, all three wrestlers performed their finishers, but a Rock Bottom on Triple H gave The Rock the victory.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><!--nextpage--><h3>#5 The Big Show<\/h3><p><iframe style=\"max-width:100%\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/RRQ--SCdHKo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p><p>Big Show and Brock Lesnar have faced each other on numerous occasions in the WWE ever since Lesnar made his debut in the promotion back in 2002. But Lesnar's record against The Big Show has been incredibly, losing only once in singles matches.<\/p><p>The only loss for Lesnar against Show was back in 2002 Survivor Series, which was also the show which hosted the first-ever Elimination Chamber match.<\/p><p>Lesnar, who held the WWE Championship (the Undisputed Championship was renamed as the WWE Championship), after winning it from The Rock earlier that year at SummerSlam, was to defend the title once again at Survivor Series in 2002.<\/p><p>Lesnar had defeated The Undertaker at No Mercy, and bragged about how he could never be defeated, to which Big Show challenged him. The two assaulted each other on SmackDown leading up to their Survivor Series match, and at the show, Big Show defeated Lesnar to win the WWE Championship, as well as inflict Lesnar with his first loss by pinfall.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p>",

While one took his team all the way to the World Cup finals after a fantastic year with his club, the other is regarded as one of the most underrated Real Madrid players of all time.<\/p><p>Surely, the two have been compared on multiple occasions in terms of their appearance, style of play, and leadership qualities, but belonging to different eras and being a part of different squads have drawn out some factors that really set them apart.<\/p><p>Not only do they play in completely different positions in midfield, but their climb up the ladder of the first team has also made them different from each other. Guti started off as a striker, transitioning into a midfielder, and Modric came from being a 'regista' to a central midfielder.<\/p><p>While they may have same passing abilities or dribbling skills, 3 features set them apart totally. However, that does not put aside the fact that the duo have made major contributions to their club's success.<\/p><hr><\/hr><h3>#3 Consistency<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/c5966-15444482497153-800.jpg\" alt=\"Guti barely ever was injured, but found it really hard to make an impact\" \/><figcaption>Guti barely ever was injured, but found it really hard to make an impact<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>One of the best things Guti was actually known for was his ability to pass the ball through some of the tightest spaces, creating what was called 'magic moments' for the likes of Ronaldo and Raul.<\/p><p>In fact, playing from a central role and transitioning into an attacking #10 was one of his special qualities. However, unlike Modric, the Spaniard lacked the consistency and the opportunity.<\/p><p>To be specific, Madrid had many reliable options in the form of Zinedine Zidane, which forced Guti to miss out on most of the matches earlier in his career. Guti barely ever was injured, but found it really hard to make an impact.<\/p><blockquote>\"All the doors are closing on me. I was improving as a midfielder, and Zidane arrived. I was improving as a forward and Ronaldo arrived. I'm now in the national team as a midfielder and Beckham comes\" - Guti 2003<\/blockquote><p>The Croatian on the other hand, has been extremely fluid with what he does. Winning 4 Champions League titles with his side, Modric has been more consistent than his counterpart. Featuring in almost all of the major games for Real Madrid is a reflection of his ability to be more fluid with his style of play.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><!--nextpage--><h3>#2 Style of play<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/362ad-15444459271193-800.jpg\" alt=\"Modric is a more complete midfielder than Guti\" \/><figcaption>Modric is a more complete midfielder than Guti<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The most obvious similarities between the two midfielders are their work rate. Both Modric and Guti are sort of like the 'gears' that runs\/ran the machinery of Real Madrid. Quick, agile, and genius, the two are the ideal playmakers when it comes to the midfield. <\/p><p>While Guti played mostly as an attacking midfielder, Modric in recent times has developed into a #10 as well, as was evident with his time with the Croatian national team.<\/p><p>However, their positions aside, they have distinct differences in terms of their style of play. Modric is a typical central midfielder, a midfielder who controls the flow of the game and takes charge of making sure his team does not frail, building the game from the back, playing box to box, as well as using pace and long-range passes. He is regarded as the master of the 'pre-assist'.<\/p><p>Guti on the other hand, was responsible for beating the defence in order to create the attacking opportunity required in order to score goals. His excellent vision as an attacking midfielder made him one of the players with the most number of assists in multiple seasons. <\/p><p>Unlike Modric, the Spaniard would usually situate himself in the midst of the action, waiting for the right opportunity. He was also known for doing the unexpected, such as accurately delivering a pass using the back-heel.<\/p><p>Overall, Modric looks like a more 'complete' midfielder, as he has the ability to play in multiple positions.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><!--nextpage--><h3>#1 Personality<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/2ae14-15444460373762-800.jpg\" alt=\"Guti achieved first-team success later in his career\" \/><figcaption>Guti achieved first-team success later in his career<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>While Guti appeared to be taller and stronger, Modric is shorter. In the case of the Croatian, his low centre of gravity has actually allowed him to move past defenders more quickly. Meanwhile, talking about similarities, the duo have always portrayed leadership qualities appreciated by teammates.<\/p><p>Guti was always shy of opportunities due to the presence of Luis Figo or Zinedine Zidane, but he still tried his level best to register himself as one of the foremost Real Madrid midfielders, but was not really able to do it like Luka Modric.<\/p><p>Modric's recruitment in 2012 was questioned by many, but he was quickly able to climb the ladder, as he was not shy of opportunities. His presence on the field has spoken widely for him, as he has played a very important role in the resurrection of Real Madrid in the 2010s.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p>",

He's been playing for 19 seasons now and has been a part of six teams. His average is 13.8 points and 3.8 assists which is higher than average considering he has well over 1400 career games.<\/p><p>This veteran has been playing for the Bucks for the last few seasons, where he averaged 3.3 points and 16 minutes per game making him great on bench support for any team. While he is currently \"retired\", he is still a part of the free agency. Further, he has publically stated that he is willing to come back, given the right offer. The right offer in this situation seems to be only those coming from the Lakers, Warriors or the Mavericks.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, a spot on these BIG 3 teams seems quite unlikely. On the other hand, it is good to know that he won't be leaving this retirement period to start playing for the lottery of teams on the Eastern conference and will just stick to the big guns in the west. Nonetheless, here are some reasons it would be good to have him back.<\/p><hr><\/hr><h3>#1 His shooting prowess<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/554bc-15444446758319-800.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Terry Shooting a Three\" \/><figcaption>Jason Terry Shooting a Three<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>There are some glaring holes in Terry's playing style such as his inability to rebound even though he has proven himself as a great defender. But, moving on from those he has proven himself extremely useful on the other side of the court.<\/p><p>To the surprise of many, Terry has held uncountable records in terms of shooting spread across many different parts of his career. As apart of the Celtics, his three-point percentage stood at .380 just behind Allen's make of .400<\/p><p>Even though these numbers have dropped with age and loss of agility, Terry is still extremely reliably with bringing the ball to the ring and with free throws. Especially for the lack of minutes he has gotten off late these numbers still stand impressive.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><!--nextpage--><h3>#2 His on-court experience<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/b6a5f-15444447385030-800.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Terry as a part of the Mavericks\" \/><figcaption>Jason Terry as a part of the Mavericks<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Even in the 2017-2018 season if you were to watch the pre-game shootaround and if you were lucky enough to see his three-pointers you will realize that this is not just any other player. <\/p><p>There are very few players who can claim the number of games he has played (there are only 7 people above his record) and there are also very few players that maintain his skill going into their forties. However, most of all his drive is what makes him so special.<\/p><p>Further, this experience has led to one of the highest game IQ's to be ever seen on an NBA court. He is one of the most illustrated sixth men as well. He has one NBA championship (2011-Dallas), a sixth man of the year trophy (2009), an NCAA championship (Arizona), amongst many other accolades.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><!--nextpage--><h3>#3 The versatility Terry provides<\/h3><figure class= \"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/static.sportskeeda.com\/editor\/2018\/12\/1fa92-15444448449388-800.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Terry Hopes to Return to the NBA This Season\" \/><figcaption>Jason Terry Hopes to Return to the NBA This Season<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Over time Jason Terry has played many different roles in the different teams he has been a part of. An excellent first man, he also has had immense potential as a starter in the earlier years of his career. Terry can help out in any place required, provided he is recruited.<\/p><p>Though his shorter built makes him more of a two-guard, Terry has proved extremely competent at playing the point as required. His age and on ground presence have lent him with high basketball IQ that always provides his teammates with not only help but eases the pressure off of younger players. His father-like presence has proven to be helpful to overall team vibe and to ease dressing room tensions while he was a part of the Mavericks over the last few seasons.<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p><p>&#8203;<\/p>",
